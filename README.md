# Presentation.Responsive

This is the presentation files and demos for the presentation **Responsive Web Design - An app is
not enough**

## Abstract

Native or web? That seems to be one of the biggest questions on the market right now. But what do
you do when an app is not enough? How can you create something that works great on a 4" phone as
well as on a 60" television?

Responsive web design can be the answer for you and it's one of the hottest trend in web design
right now. Joakim will use this technique to give you an understanding of how to design and code
web applications for 2012 and beyond. The result will be shown in a demo that will possibly change
the way you think about the web.

## Known issues

* The presentation crashes Safari for iPad.
* The presentation doesn't work on Internet Explorer and Opera.
* The presentation doesn't look good on Firefox.
* The source code doesn't show in Chrome unless served from a webserver.

Long story short: It's made for Safari, I present it using Safari so Safari is probably the best
way to watch this presentation :-) Maybe I'll fix it in the future, maybe not.
