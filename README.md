# Presentation.Responsive

This is the presentation files and demos for the presentation **Responsive Web Design** - An app is not enough.

## Known issues

The presentation is only tested in Safari 5.1.7 for Mac and even there it's not perfect. I will continue to make it better.

Some of the demos will requires a web server and will not run from the file system.
