        <p>Hello and welcome to the presentation "An app is not enough!"</p>
        <p>
            There is a lot of discussions regarding apps vs sites and native vs web. While
            that debate is interesting the most important thing is getting your message
            across to your customers and building useful applications that your users will
            use, and love to use, regardless of what kind of device they are using.
        </p>
        <p>
            In this talk I thought I'd show you a way you can do this today without
            throwing away everything you know. There will be code and there will be some
            examples so I hope you will like it.
        </p>
        <p>
            My name is Joakim Kemeny and I work as a consultant with front end development
            at Callista Enterprise. We have a small office here in Stockholm but I work
            for our office in Gothenburg. Web and mobile are part of every assignment these
            days and even if I don't do public web sites lite SVT or Boston Globe every day
            I still benefit from the techniques that I'm going to show you today so
            hopefully I will be able to give you some useful tips.
        </p>
        <p>So let's get started.</p>
    </div>

        <p>
            This is the web site for Callista Enterprise and it's probably this way it is
            supposed to look. It's not a very hip site but it's quite normal and there are
            a lot of sites that looks like this.
        </p>
    </div>
</div>
<div id="intro-3" class="step invisible" data-x="-365" data-y="95" data-scale="0.5"
     data-rotate="-5">
    <img src="img/ipad-site.png" class="site-ipad">

    <div class="notes">
        <p>
            This is also our site but it has been scaled to fit. Still perfectly usable.
        </p>
    </div>
</div>
<div id="intro-4" class="step invisible" data-x="-650" data-y="383">
    <img src="img/display-site.png" class="site-display">

    <div class="notes">
        <p>
            This is also our site. I guess our brand color is white? At lease there is an
            awful lot of it if you look at the site like this.
        </p>
    </div>
</div>
<div id="intro-5" class="step invisible" data-x="-192" data-y="208" data-scale="0.25"
     data-rotate="5">
    <img src="img/iphone-site1.png" class="site-iphone">

    <div class="notes">
        <p>
            This is also our site. That's not really usable but I think I can see a bee in
            the image. Let's zoom in.
        </p>
    </div>
</div>
<div id="intro-6" class="step invisible" data-x="-192" data-y="208" data-scale="0.25"
     data-rotate="5">
    <img src="img/iphone-site2.png" class="site-iphone">

    <div class="notes">
        <p>
            Yes, definitely a bee hive so I guess that Callista is in the bee hive
            business. Let's swipe and look at the rest of the page.
        </p>
    </div>
</div>
<div id="intro-7" class="step invisible" data-x="-192" data-y="208" data-scale="0.25"
     data-rotate="5">
    <img src="img/iphone-site3.png" class="site-iphone">

    <div class="notes">
        <p>That's better, now it makes sense (if you understand Swedish of cause).</p>
        <p>
            You may think it's a little bit strange that I choose our web site to show the
            kind of problems that the web faces today. If our site had worked as I would
            like it to do it would be a plain marketing plug but now it's quite the
            opposite, right?
        </p>
        <p>
            The fact is that I didn't choose this site because it's good or bad, I choose it
            because it's a really good example of how the web works today. Hopefully I
            will not be able to use this example for long.
        </p>

<!-- Ignore mobile steps --------------------------------------------------------------- -->

<div id="ignore-1" class="step" data-x="1500" data-y="0">
    <ul class="option-list">
        <li>
            <span>1</span>Ignore mobile
            <span>Visitors will use a computer anyway</span>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <div class="notes">
        <p>
            So that was how I think that most of the web works today. Most of the sites out
            there simply ignores mobile. Most people will use a computer anyway, right?
        </p>
        <p>
            There are two other ways that we use to tackle mobile though.
        </p>
    </div>
</div>
<div id="ignore-1-2" class="step invisible" data-x="1500" data-y="0">
    <ul class="option-list">
        <li>
            <span>1</span>Ignore mobile
            <span>Visitors will use a computer anyway</span>
        </li>
        <li>
            <span>2</span>Create m.company.com
            <span>Mobile visitors are only interested in a subset of the information</span>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <div class="notes">
        <p>
            First. We can always create a m.company.com site. We can show a phone number and maybe
            the opening hours if it's a site for a store. No mobile users want all information
            available on the desktop site, right?
        </p>
    </div>
</div>
<div id="ignore-1-3" class="step invisible" data-x="1500" data-y="0">
    <ul class="option-list">
        <li>
            <span>1</span>Ignore mobile
            <span>Visitors will use a computer anyway</span>
        </li>
        <li>
            <span>2</span>Create m.company.com
            <span>Mobile visitors are only interested in a subset of the information</span>
        </li>
        <li>
            <span>3</span>Create an app
            <span>Redirect all mobile visitors to the app stores</span>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <div class="notes">
        <p>
            Or maybe you have a lot of money. A new budget is about to start and you need to spend
            money to get new money so lets create an app. And while we are at it, let's detect
            mobile users on our normal web site and redirect them all to the app stores. Everybody
            wants to download our app, right?
        </p>
        <p>
            So let’s dive a little bit deeper into these paths that you may take.

    <div class="notes">
        <p>So let's start with ignoring mobile.</p>
        <p>
            If this was a conference for management I would probably need to add 15 slides with
            charts and number to backup this statement but since we are at the best developer
            conference in Sweden I think that we can all agree that ignoring mobile is just stupid.

            Mobile is the future and if you still want the facts I suggest you checkout Luke
            Wroblewski's site where he have a lot of numbers about this.
        </p>
        <p>I will add some links like this throughout the presentation so look out for them.</p>
        <p>But let's not linger in the past, let's move forward.</p>
