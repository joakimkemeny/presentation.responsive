        <p>Hello and welcome to the presentation "An app is not enough!"</p>
        <p>
            There is a lot of discussions regarding apps vs sites and native vs web. While
            that debate is interesting the most important thing is getting your message
            across to your customers and building useful applications that your users will
            use, and love to use, regardless of what kind of device they are using.
        </p>
        <p>
            In this talk I thought I'd show you a way you can do this today without
            throwing away everything you know. There will be code and there will be some
            examples so I hope you will like it.
        </p>
        <p>
            My name is Joakim Kemeny and I work as a consultant with front end development
            at Callista Enterprise. We have a small office here in Stockholm but I work
            for our office in Gothenburg. Web and mobile are part of every assignment these
            days and even if I don't do public web sites lite SVT or Boston Globe every day
            I still benefit from the techniques that I'm going to show you today so
            hopefully I will be able to give you some useful tips.
        </p>
        <p>So let's get started.</p>
    </div>

        <p>
            This is the web site for Callista Enterprise and it's probably this way it is
            supposed to look. It's not a very hip site but it's quite normal and there are
            a lot of sites that looks like this.
        </p>
    </div>
</div>
<div id="intro-3" class="step invisible" data-x="-365" data-y="95" data-scale="0.5"
     data-rotate="-5">
    <img src="img/ipad-site.png" class="site-ipad">

    <div class="notes">
        <p>
            This is also our site but it has been scaled to fit. Still perfectly usable.
        </p>
    </div>
</div>
<div id="intro-4" class="step invisible" data-x="-650" data-y="383">
    <img src="img/display-site.png" class="site-display">

    <div class="notes">
        <p>
            This is also our site. I guess our brand color is white? At lease there is an
            awful lot of it if you look at the site like this.
        </p>
    </div>
</div>
<div id="intro-5" class="step invisible" data-x="-192" data-y="208" data-scale="0.25"

    <img src="img/iphone-site1.png" class="site-iphone">

    <div class="notes">
        <p>
            This is also our site. That's not really usable but I think I can see a bee in
            the image. Let's zoom in.
        </p>
    </div>
</div>
<div id="intro-6" class="step invisible" data-x="-192" data-y="208" data-scale="0.25"

    <div class="notes">
        <p>
            Yes, definitely a bee hive so I guess that Callista is in the bee hive
            business. Let's swipe and look at the rest of the page.
        </p>
    </div>

<div id="intro-7" class="step invisible" data-x="-192" data-y="208" data-scale="0.25"

    <div class="notes">
        <p>That's better, now it makes sense (if you understand Swedish of cause).</p>
        <p>
            You may think it's a little bit strange that I choose our web site to show the
            kind of problems that the web faces today. If our site had worked as I would
            like it to do it would be a plain marketing plug but now it's quite the
            opposite, right?
        </p>
        <p>
            The fact is that I didn't choose this site because it's good or bad, I choose it
            because it's a really good example of how the web works today. Hopefully I
            will not be able to use this example for long.
        </p>

<!-- Ignore mobile steps --------------------------------------------------------------- -->

<div id="ignore-1" class="step" data-x="1500" data-y="0">
    <ul class="option-list">
        <li>
            <span>1</span>Ignore mobile
            <span>Visitors will use a computer anyway</span>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <div class="notes">
        <p>
            So that was how I think that most of the web works today. Most of the sites out
            there simply ignores mobile. Most people will use a computer anyway, right?
        </p>
        <p>
            There are two other ways that we use to tackle mobile though.
        </p>
    </div>
</div>
<div id="ignore-1-2" class="step invisible" data-x="1500" data-y="0">
    <ul class="option-list">
        <li>
            <span>1</span>Ignore mobile
            <span>Visitors will use a computer anyway</span>
        </li>
        <li>
            <span>2</span>Create m.company.com
            <span>Mobile visitors are only interested in a subset of the information</span>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <div class="notes">
        <p>
            First. We can always create a m.company.com site. We can show a phone number and maybe
            the opening hours if it's a site for a store. No mobile users want all information
            available on the desktop site, right?
        </p>
    </div>
</div>
<div id="ignore-1-3" class="step invisible" data-x="1500" data-y="0">
    <ul class="option-list">
        <li>
            <span>1</span>Ignore mobile

        </li>
        <li>
            <span>2</span>Create m.company.com
            <span>Mobile visitors are only interested in a subset of the information</span>
        </li>
        <li>
            <span>3</span>Create an app
            <span>Redirect all mobile visitors to the app stores</span>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <div class="notes">
        <p>
            Or maybe you have a lot of money. A new budget is about to start and you need to spend
            money to get new money so lets create an app. And while we are at it, let's detect
            mobile users on our normal web site and redirect them all to the app stores. Everybody
            wants to download our app, right?
        </p>
        <p>
            So let’s dive a little bit deeper into these paths that you may take.

    <div class="notes">
        <p>So let's start with ignoring mobile.</p>
        <p>
            If this was a conference for management I would probably need to add 15 slides with
            charts and number to backup this statement but since we are at the best developer
            conference in Sweden I think that we can all agree that ignoring mobile is just stupid.

            So, a separate mobile site, that sounds good right? It can be in some cases but I have
            to
            say that I'm not convinced.
        </p>
        <p>
            On of the companies that was early adopters of this approach was Swedish Radio (SR). I
            even think they wan an award for this a couple of years back.
        </p>
        <p>
            However I was traveling by car about a half year ago or so. All of the sudden we had to
            stop due to a traffic accident. Of cause I picked up my phone and started looking for
            information about this and ended up on Swedish Radio Skaraborg.
        </p>

<div id="domain-3" class="step" data-x="1500" data-y="2000">
    <img src="img/sr-fail1.png" class="left-image">

    <div class="notes">
        <p>
            I was really happy about this because even though I don't think you can see much here
            I actually thought I could see something about the traffic. I zoomed in and yes, there
            was an entry about a traffic accident on E20 down there.
        </p>
        <p>Then the page disappeared, and this page appeared instead.</p>
    </div>
</div>
<div id="domain-3-2" class="step invisible" data-x="1500" data-y="2000">

    <img src="img/sr-fail2.png" class="right-image">

    <div class="notes">
        <p>
            So they detected that I was using a mobile browser and redirected me to their mobile
            site. The only problem was that the page was not available in the mobile version so no
            information for me.
        </p>

<div id="domain-3-3" class="step invisible" data-x="1500" data-y="2100">

    <div class="notes">
        <p>
            This is the problem with the m.company.com approach. You have to maintain two different
            sets of pages and that is doomed to fail.
        </p>
        <p>So creating m.company.com is, well, it's not great.</p>

            Apps can be really great. I love developing iOS apps and in many cases I prefer an
            app over the web and I guess this leads us to the App vs Site discussion.
        </p>
        <p>
            For me there is no single answer but when question arises I tend to lean on these
            questions for guidance.

            How often am I going to use the application. I have 113 apps installed on my phone and

            The final question is of cause if the application needs access to my device. Web sites
            can do some things but they will always be playing catchup with native applications.
        </p>
        <p>
            There are of cause other factors as well but they are more of a greyzone to me but if

            So here is an example. Here are two companies that have apps but no mobile site. Did
            they make the right choice?
        </p>
        <p>
            First we have Systembolaget. I don't know if there are anybody in the audience that are
            not familiar with Systembolaget but it's one of two places you get your beer, wine and
            liquor in Sweden, the other is of cause Germany.
        </p>
        <p>
            They have a great app. But will I use it everyday? Hopefully not. Do I want it to talk
            to me? Hey, we are running out of beer, hurry up before it's to late? No, not really.
            Does it need access to my device, I can't see why. So this a clear web site for me.

            Next is Västtrafik, the company that i responsible for buses, trams and trains in
            western of Sweden and are famous for how easy it is to pay them the right amount of
            money.

            I use it everyday and I guess most people that travel a lot do. And wouldn't it be
            great if you could pick your favourite routes and be notified if you normal bus is late?
            It doesn't really need access to my phone yet but NFC would be great. So for me this is
            a clear app.

            So this is one way of looking at it. The other is that it’s really hard to create a
            mobile app today. Let’s look at Android for a minute.

            This picture is a little bit old now but it comes from a report from OpenSignalMaps
            where they tracked half a million downloads of their app. What they found was 3 997
            different Android devices. Many of them are of cause not that different since they are
            considered to be different if they are from different manufacturers, have different
            version number, have different resolution, and so on, but still. This is remarkable.
        </p>
        <p>
            Some consider this a problem for open source, other see it the other way around but I
            think we can agree that it’s a challenge.

            An other way to look at the same report is to only focus on screen resolution. It
            reaches from 200 pixels to over 2000 and everything in between. How can we create apps
            that are flexible enough to handle this?

            Finally we have our newest friend in let’s-make-life-hard-for-the-developer-world –
            pixel densities. Phones have been struggling with this for a while now where a pixel
            is not always a pixel. But now when the new tablets and computers also are starting to
            use this technique you really notice the difference.

            But it’s hard and we really need to make our apps or web sites really really flexible.

    <div class="notes">
        <p>So where does this leave us with creating apps.</p>
        <p>
            It’s definitely an option but it’s hard to make apps that are flexible enough and for
            some use cases I don’t think it’s feasible at all.
        </p>
        <p>
            So creating an app is, you should probably see this one coming.
